### Step#1: [Fork](https://github.com/FireHead90544/Hello-Hacktoberfest2021/fork) and clone the repository
### Step#2: Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-user`
### Step#3: Create a new folder inside `contributions` folder and name the folder as `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`.
### Step#4: Create a new file inside `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` folder of any programming language with `ANY-NAME.extension`, Remember, extension can be of any programming language of your choice. For example, for python create a file named `hacktoberfestop.py`, for javascript create a file named `myhacktoberfest.js`, the name totally relies upon you :)
### Step#5: Inside the file you just created (of programming language of your choice), write a program to print `"Hello Hacktoberfest2021!"`. 
`NOTE: Don't forget to add these info at the top of your file inside comments, an example of doing the same in python.`
```python3
# NAME: YOUR_NAME
# GITHUB USERNAMME: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
# COUNTRY: YOUR_COUNTRY
# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: YOUR_FAVOURITE_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE
# I LOVE HACKTOBERFEST2021
```

### Step#6: Add your files `git add -A`
### Step#7: Commit your changes `git commit -m "My Contribution"`
### Step#8: Push to your fork `git push origin new-user` and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/FireHead90544/Hello-Hacktoberfest2021/compare).
### Step#9: Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

<details>
<summary>Are pull requests counted towards Hacktoberfest 2021?</summary>
<br>
   This repo is to welcome beginners to Github and the opensource community by helping them learn how to make their first PR and contributions to open source!
<br>
That said, only high-quality contributions and pull requests that add value to Open Source projects are part of the core values of Hacktoberfest, so repositories like this one and others which allow users to quickly gain a PR toward completing the challenge might be excluded from the Hacktoberfest.
<br>
So we highly recommend you to contribute in a meaningful way to other Hacktoberfest issues and not rely on this repository alone.
